# README

I had trouble getting the repo to work at first, since some of the dependencies didn't install because I'm not on a Mac machine.

I also didn't have much time to work on this, I can discuss this more in person.

Overall, I didn't put Redux in due to time restraints, and it's really unpolished, I didn't have enough time to really put my best foot forward with this.
